# CSOD-connector
A connector for Cornerstone Integration 


This projcts aims to build a connector service. The entire application can be deployed on Heroku platform. 

Currently this connector connects to Cornerstone endpoint and retrives OU(Operational Unit) data. Heroku run this script as a cron job 
which could be the best solution in an Integration project. Application uses flask framework, although this is not required at all and will be removed from following commits.
