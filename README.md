# CSOD-connector
A connector for Cornerstone Integration 


This projcts aims to build a connector service. The entire application can be deployed on Heroku platform. 

Currently this connector connects to Cornerstone endpoint and retrives OU(Operational Unit) data. Heroku give functionality of configuring this application to run as cron job 
which could be the best solution in an Integration project. Although application uses flask framework, although this is not required at all.
